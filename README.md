# React Portal Demos

A few demos on how the new portal API can be used with React.

## Starting a demo

If you don't have parcel you must first install it:

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

Navigate to a demo directory. Install dependencies then run `start`. This will require `parcel` to be install globally on you machine.

```
cd event-bubbling
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then goto `http://localhost:1234/`
